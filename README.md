Rotating Windmill Simulation (Computer Graphics Mini Project)

This mini project demonstrates a rotating windmill animation built using Python and PyOpenGL. It showcases fundamental computer graphics concepts such as transformations, animation, and user interaction.

Project Description

The program renders an animated windmill scene that includes a sky, sun, clouds, ground, and a windmill with rotating blades. Users can interact with the simulation to control animation speed, pause or resume motion, and scale the windmill size.

This project helps in understanding 2D graphics rendering and real-time animation using OpenGL in Python.

Technologies Used

Python

PyOpenGL

GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)

Features

Real-time windmill blade rotation

Adjustable rotation speed

Windmill size scaling

Pause and resume functionality

Reset to default settings

Smooth animation using double buffering

Keyboard Controls
Key	Action
SPACE	Pause / Resume animation
UP Arrow	Increase rotation speed
DOWN Arrow	Decrease rotation speed
L	Increase windmill size
S	Decrease windmill size
R	Reset animation
ESC	Exit program
How to Run
1. Install Required Libraries
pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate


Depending on your system, you may also need FreeGLUT installed.

2. Run the Program
python animation.py


A window will open displaying the animated windmill simulation.

Concepts Demonstrated

2D Orthographic Projection

Translation, Rotation, and Scaling transformations

Animation using timer callbacks

Keyboard and special key input handling

Scene rendering using basic OpenGL primitives
